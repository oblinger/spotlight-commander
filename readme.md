# About

SPOTLIGHTER updates spotlight terms at each retrieval failure point
in order to rapid converge to a state where all 'places' used by a user
are loaded correctly loaded based on the first word that occurs to the user.





# Basic Usage 

Operating at the speed of thought.

- Think of (or invent) a name for the 'place' (url,doc,etc.) you want to open.

- Type that name into spotlight.  (Press Command-space to open spotlight)

- If that did not work then 
  - Open that 'place' manually
  - Enter 'ss' to SPOTLIGHT SAVE for next time.
  
  
# Advanced Usage

OUT OF DATE NAME -- Don't worry about those, there will be hundreds of them, but they can only 
hurt you ONCE.  You will type it and an old 'place' will display, but at that time you will update
that word to the 'new place.

NAME COLLISIONS -- If one name means two different (actively accessed) things to you.  Then invent 
a different name for one of them.  You will be surprised if you actively choose an alternate name 
for a thing.  Often your mind will quickly adopt this new name -- problem solved.

HARD COLLISIONS -- In very rare cases 
 
 (I only have two yet I have thousands of commands)
will only
affect you ONCE when you try to use that word and expect

# Motivation

One key way that people keep track of thousands of 'things'  (projects, people, foods, songs, etc.)
is to use or invent NAMES for those things.

By continuously adjusting mapping of NAMES to "THINGS" on the computer, a user can ensure the first 
word they think of always launches the right thing.

But mapping user thought frictionlessly to correct action requires REMOVING many road blocks beyond 
the naming of places.  These include:

FEEDBACK LOOPS -- Actions like moving a mouse to some icon or button, or searching through a 
list of spotlight results to select the correct one, both involve a conscious feedback loop 
where the user must place there attention on the feedback loop itself breaking them out of the flow
of what they are doing.  Responsive keyboard interfaces with commands with known effect avoid 
such loops, allowing actions to be built into 'muscle memory' over time where actions take no more 
thought than typing a word does for a touch typist.  

MODES, STATES, and APPLICATIONS -- All require the user to plan a path from the 'place' where they 
are currently at to the desired place.  So reasoning about whether your browser is currently opened,
what interface commands are needed to get to it, commands needed to get the correct tab with the 
search portal open, etc.  All result in a surprising amount of micro complexity which pulls one out
of the flow of the task at hand.  Ensuring that command trigger appropriate .....

ONE WAY -- If *ALL* actions are handled in a single way, then the details ...

points of friction we have come



----------

Achieving this low friction state where user thought maps to correct action



to keep things separate 
in our heads is the use or invent names for those things.

Spotlight-ninja leverages this tendency, by letting us tell the computer 
what name we already remember for a thing.  Then later finding it is a
matter of providing the name we already know.

It important that WE get to chose the names of things, since our name is often
a simplification or alternative to some official name created by the author.





# OLD TEXTS

TYPE A NAME INTO SPOTLIGHT --
    Type the name of the 'place' where you want to be.  
    - If your place loads you are done.  get busy....
    - If that name does not exist, you can create it by typing:  'new' into spotlight.
    
MANUALLY SELECT CORRECT FILE OR WEBPAGE
    Manually select in the finder to the entry that should have opened,
    or in Chrome open the URL that should have opened.
    
TYPE 'fix' INTO SPOTLIGHT
   This will 'fix' the entry to point to this new location.



to continuously improve 
so expected documents, URLs, etc.
are 

provides direct control of the words spotlight uses to launch documents, folder, URLs, etc.

Allows use to eliminate 'retrieval friction' by continuously tweaking 
mapping in user's head and spotlight's catalog so the top hit on
the first word a user thinks is always yields the folder, file, or website 
they wanted.

Over time, using names the user already has in their head, they will end
up in any one of thousands of locations w/o search, friction of mental 
effort.
