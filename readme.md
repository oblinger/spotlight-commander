# About

Provides direct control of words spotlight uses to launch documents, folder, URLs, etc.

Allows use to eliminate 'retrieval friction' by continuously tweaking 
mapping in user's head and spotlight's catalog so the top hit on
the first word a user thinks is always yields the folder, file, or website 
they wanted.

Over time, using names the user already has in their head, they will end
up in any one of thousands of locations w/o search, friction of mental 
effort.

    - If that name does not exist, you can create it by typing:  'new' into spotlight.
    
MANUALLY SELECT CORRECT FILE OR WEBPAGE
    Manually select in the finder to the entry that should have opened,
    or in Chrome open the URL that should have opened.

   This will 'fix' the entry to point to this new location.


# Motivation

We naturally keep track of tens of thousands of 'things'
people, foods, songs, places, etc.  One key way to keep things separate 
in our heads is the use or invent names for those things.

Spotlight-ninja leverages this tendency, by letting us tell the computer 
what name we already remember for a thing.  Then later finding it is a
matter of providing the name we already know.

It important that WE get to chose the names of things, since our name is often
a simplification or alternative to some official name created by the author.
