# About

SPOTLIGHT COMMANDER continuously updates thousands spotlight aliases for specific documents, folders, and web pages.

Instead of YOU remembering what each thing is called as where it is, 
why isn't your COMPUTER remembering what you call each thing, so you do have to?


# Installation

- Download the [installer zip file](https://docs.google.com/uc?authuser=0&id=0B1nxErVPR2RaLTBvb2pLTVdRZmM&export=download).
- Double click on the SpotlightCommander.app file.


# Basic Usage 

Operating at the speed of thought -- Trying to remember where something is or what it is called, 
traversing file folders to find it, using the mouse, and opening up 'viewer' applications,  
all break our mental flow.

We should just be able think of the name of any one of a thousand 'things', and that thing simply appears.

To achieve this we must not put spotlight things into OUR HEADS, instead we must whats in our head INTO SPOTLIGHT!


**USAGE PATTERN** 

    EACH TIME you go to one of your frequent files, folders, or websites:
    
    - Type the name of that 'place' into spotlight.
      (IMPORTANT:  Invent a one-word nickname for the place if it does not already have a natural short name
                   Its ok to even invent a "comboword" word if needed.)

    - If your desired 'place' did not appear then
      - Go that 'place' manually, and
      - Type 'fix' into spotlight in order to "fix" the nickname for next time.
  

  
# Advanced Usage

OUT OF DATE NAME -- Don't worry about those, there will be hundreds of them, but they can only 
hurt you ONCE.  You will type it and an old 'place' will display, but at that time you will update
that word to the 'new place.

NAME COLLISIONS -- If one name means two different (actively accessed) things to you.  Then invent 
a different name for one of them.  You will be surprised if you actively choose an alternate name 
for a thing.  Often your mind will quickly adopt this new name -- problem solved.

HARD COLLISIONS -- In very rare cases 
 
 (I only have two yet I have thousands of commands)
will only
affect you ONCE when you try to use that word and expect
